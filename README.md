### Hi there 👋
- 🌱 I value simplicity, clarity, and straightforwardness.
- 👯 I mostly enjoy automating data and analysis, from data collection (i.e., web scraping), to large-scale model testing (i.e., running hundreds or thousands of various scenarios and seeing the model performances/distributions) to productize/operationalize models.
- 😄 Technologies I've worked in: Python (Web Scraping and Machine Learning), SQL, SAS, Tableau/PowerBI, Excel VBA/macro
- 😉 Technologies I've used: R, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, Django
- 🤔 I’m currently learning deploying Django App via Heroku.
